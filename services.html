                    <p class="mb-5">
                        A nutrition counsellor or nutrition coach is a supportive resource in helping you make healthier
                        choices. They’ll
                        work with you to identify problems and gaps in your nutrition and suggest ways to incorporate
                        healthy foods into your lifestyle. They will also show you how to accurately track your food and
                        set realistic weight loss goals.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You’ll learn what foods will maximize your health and energy, as well as foods you may want to
                        avoid. Your nutrition coach will discuss your current lifestyle and food habits to evaluate
                        which areas might benefit from eating more or less. Evaluating these together will help you make
                        a focus plan on how to reach your personal health goals.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        With a hands-on approach, a nutrition coach is able to help you prepare list of snacks, create a
                        custom grocery list, and target specific eating habits you want to change.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Although nutrition counsellors take a more standardized approach, you will leave each
                        appointment
                        with the information needed to make healthy nutrition choices. Working with a nutrition
                        coach is a great starting point if you’re looking to get on the path to a healthier you.

                <q><em>I have struggled with my weight for the last several years. I have tried prepared meals and
                        support
                        groups but with very little success. I have been having issues with indigestion and required
                        daily
                        prescribed medications which did not control my indigestion most days.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Susan had me fill out a form with all my medical issues, food intolerance's and diet habits.
                        Susan
                        then had me do a gut repair diet for two weeks. Afterwards I started a meal plan/diet which I
                        have
                        been following for several weeks now. I initially was somewhat intimidated because I did not
                        cook
                        very much and actually hated cooking. Susan provided a shopping list, meal plan and recipes. I
                        can
                        honestly say now I enjoy cooking the meals, and the shopping is straight forward with my list (I
                        used to hate shopping too). I really enjoy all the meals and so does my family. I open my fridge
                        and
                        love seeing all the healthy food in there now.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Now, for the best part that everyone would like to know!</strong>
                        <br>
                        I was so shocked how much weight I lost the first week! AND I continue to lose between 2-3
                        pounds
                        weekly. AND I still love the food with all the variety. My indigestion has improved enormously
                        and I
                        rarely take my prescribed medication. Susan is so supportive and attentive which is an added
                        bonus!
                        Many thanks and much gratitude to Susan who not only helped me lose weight but also for the
                        lifestyle change!
